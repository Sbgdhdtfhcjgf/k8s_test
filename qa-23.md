## Question 23 | Kubelet client/server cert info

*Task weight: 2%*

 

Use context: `kubectl config use-context k8s-c2-AC`

 

Node cluster2-node1 has been added to the cluster using `kubeadm` and TLS bootstrapping.

Find the "Issuer" and "Extended Key Usage" values of the cluster2-node1:

1. kubelet **client** certificate, the one used for outgoing connections to the kube-apiserver.
2. kubelet **server** certificate, the one used for incoming connections from the kube-apiserver.

Write the information into file `/opt/course/23/certificate-info.txt`.

Compare the "Issuer" and "Extended Key Usage" fields of both certificates and make sense of these.

 

##### Answer:

To find the correct kubelet certificate directory, we can look for the default value of the `--cert-dir` parameter for the kubelet. For this search for "kubelet" in the Kubernetes docs which will lead to: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet. We can check if another certificate directory has been configured using `ps aux` or in `/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf`.

First we check the kubelet client certificate:

```
➜ ssh cluster2-node1

➜ root@cluster2-node1:~# openssl x509  -noout -text -in /var/lib/kubelet/pki/kubelet-client-current.pem | grep Issuer
        Issuer: CN = kubernetes
        
➜ root@cluster2-node1:~# openssl x509  -noout -text -in /var/lib/kubelet/pki/kubelet-client-current.pem | grep "Extended Key Usage" -A1
            X509v3 Extended Key Usage: 
                TLS Web Client Authentication
```

Next we check the kubelet server certificate:

```
➜ root@cluster2-node1:~# openssl x509  -noout -text -in /var/lib/kubelet/pki/kubelet.crt | grep Issuer
          Issuer: CN = cluster2-node1-ca@1588186506

➜ root@cluster2-node1:~# openssl x509  -noout -text -in /var/lib/kubelet/pki/kubelet.crt | grep "Extended Key Usage" -A1
            X509v3 Extended Key Usage: 
                TLS Web Server Authentication
```

We see that the server certificate was generated on the worker node itself and the client certificate was issued by the Kubernetes api. The "Extended Key Usage" also shows if it's for client or server authentication.

## Question 13 | Multi Containers and Pod shared Volume

*Task weight: 4%*

 

Use context: `kubectl config use-context k8s-c1-H`

 

Create a *Pod* named `multi-container-playground` in *Namespace* `default` with three containers, named `c1`, `c2` and `c3`. There should be a volume attached to that *Pod* and mounted into every container, but the volume shouldn't be persisted or shared with other *Pods*.

Container `c1` should be of image `nginx:1.17.6-alpine` and have the name of the node where its *Pod* is running available as environment variable MY_NODE_NAME.

Container `c2` should be of image `busybox:1.31.1` and write the output of the `date` command every second in the shared volume into file `date.log`. You can use `while true; do date >> /your/vol/path/date.log; sleep 1; done` for this.

Container `c3` should be of image `busybox:1.31.1` and constantly send the content of file `date.log` from the shared volume to stdout. You can use `tail -f /your/vol/path/date.log` for this.

Check the logs of container `c3` to confirm correct setup.

## Question 14 | Find out Cluster Information

*Task weight: 2%*

 

Use context: `kubectl config use-context k8s-c1-H`

 

You're ask to find out following information about the cluster `k8s-c1-H`:

1. How many controlplane nodes are available?
2. How many worker nodes are available?
3. What is the Service CIDR?
4. Which Networking (or CNI Plugin) is configured and where is its config file?
5. Which suffix will static pods have that run on cluster1-node1?

Write your answers into file `/opt/course/14/cluster-info`, structured like this:

```
# /opt/course/14/cluster-info
1: [ANSWER]
2: [ANSWER]
3: [ANSWER]
4: [ANSWER]
5: [ANSWER]
```

##### Answer:

###### How many controlplane and worker nodes are available?

```
➜ k get node
NAME                    STATUS   ROLES          AGE   VERSION
cluster1-controlplane1  Ready    control-plane  27h   v1.28.2
cluster1-node1          Ready    <none>         27h   v1.28.2
cluster1-node2          Ready    <none>         27h   v1.28.2
```

We see one controlplane and two workers.

###### What is the Service CIDR?

```
➜ ssh cluster1-controlplane1

➜ root@cluster1-controlplane1:~# cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml | grep range
    - --service-cluster-ip-range=10.96.0.0/12
```

###### Which Networking (or CNI Plugin) is configured and where is its config file?

```
➜ root@cluster1-controlplane1:~# find /etc/cni/net.d/
/etc/cni/net.d/
/etc/cni/net.d/10-weave.conflist

➜ root@cluster1-controlplane1:~# cat /etc/cni/net.d/10-weave.conflist
{
    "cniVersion": "0.3.0",
    "name": "weave",
...
```

By default the kubelet looks into `/etc/cni/net.d` to discover the CNI plugins. This will be the same on every controlplane and worker nodes.

 

###### Which suffix will static pods have that run on cluster1-node1?

The suffix is the node hostname with a leading hyphen. It used to be `-static` in earlier Kubernetes versions.

 

###### Result

The resulting `/opt/course/14/cluster-info` could look like:

```
# /opt/course/14/cluster-info

# How many controlplane nodes are available?
1: 1

# How many worker nodes are available?
2: 2

# What is the Service CIDR?
3: 10.96.0.0/12

# Which Networking (or CNI Plugin) is configured and where is its config file?
4: Weave, /etc/cni/net.d/10-weave.conflist

# Which suffix will static pods have that run on cluster1-node1?
5: -cluster1-node1
```

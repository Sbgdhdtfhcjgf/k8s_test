## Question 15 | Cluster Event Logging

*Task weight: 3%*

 

Use context: `kubectl config use-context k8s-c2-AC`

 

Write a command into `/opt/course/15/cluster_events.sh` which shows the latest events in the whole cluster, ordered by time (`metadata.creationTimestamp`). Use `kubectl` for it.

Now delete the kube-proxy *Pod* running on node cluster2-node1 and write the events this caused into `/opt/course/15/pod_kill.log`.

Finally kill the containerd container of the kube-proxy *Pod* on node cluster2-node1 and write the events into `/opt/course/15/container_kill.log`.

Do you notice differences in the events both actions caused?

```bash
kubectl config use-context k8s-c2-AC
k get ev --sort-by='.metadata.creationTimestampd'
```

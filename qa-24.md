## Question 24 | NetworkPolicy

*Task weight: 9%*

 

Use context: `kubectl config use-context k8s-c1-H`

 

There was a security incident where an intruder was able to access the whole cluster from a single hacked backend *Pod*.

To prevent this create a *NetworkPolicy* called `np-backend` in *Namespace* `project-snake`. It should allow the `backend-*` *Pods* only to:

- connect to `db1-*` *Pods* on port 1111
- connect to `db2-*` *Pods* on port 2222

Use the `app` label of *Pods* in your policy.

After implementation, connections from `backend-*` *Pods* to `vault-*` *Pods* on port 3333 should for example no longer work.

 

##### Answer:

First we look at the existing *Pods* and their labels:

```
➜ k -n project-snake get pod
NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
backend-0   1/1     Running   0          8s
db1-0       1/1     Running   0          8s
db2-0       1/1     Running   0          10s
vault-0     1/1     Running   0          10s

➜ k -n project-snake get pod -L app
NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     APP
backend-0   1/1     Running   0          3m15s   backend
db1-0       1/1     Running   0          3m15s   db1
db2-0       1/1     Running   0          3m17s   db2
vault-0     1/1     Running   0          3m17s   vault
```

We test the current connection situation and see nothing is restricted:

```
➜ k -n project-snake get pod -o wide
NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP          ...
backend-0   1/1     Running   0          4m14s   10.44.0.24  ...
db1-0       1/1     Running   0          4m14s   10.44.0.25  ...
db2-0       1/1     Running   0          4m16s   10.44.0.23  ...
vault-0     1/1     Running   0          4m16s   10.44.0.22  ...

➜ k -n project-snake exec backend-0 -- curl -s 10.44.0.25:1111
database one

➜ k -n project-snake exec backend-0 -- curl -s 10.44.0.23:2222
database two

➜ k -n project-snake exec backend-0 -- curl -s 10.44.0.22:3333
vault secret storage
```

Now we create the *NP* by copying and chaning an example from the k8s docs:

```
vim 24_np.yaml
# 24_np.yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: np-backend
  namespace: project-snake
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  policyTypes:
    - Egress                    # policy is only about Egress
  egress:
    -                           # first rule
      to:                           # first condition "to"
      - podSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: db1
      ports:                        # second condition "port"
      - protocol: TCP
        port: 1111
    -                           # second rule
      to:                           # first condition "to"
      - podSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: db2
      ports:                        # second condition "port"
      - protocol: TCP
        port: 2222
```

The *NP* above has two rules with two conditions each, it can be read as:

```
allow outgoing traffic if:
  (destination pod has label app=db1 AND port is 1111)
  OR
  (destination pod has label app=db2 AND port is 2222)
```

 

###### Wrong example

Now let's shortly look at a wrong example:

```
# WRONG
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: np-backend
  namespace: project-snake
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  policyTypes:
    - Egress
  egress:
    -                           # first rule
      to:                           # first condition "to"
      - podSelector:                    # first "to" possibility
          matchLabels:
            app: db1
      - podSelector:                    # second "to" possibility
          matchLabels:
            app: db2
      ports:                        # second condition "ports"
      - protocol: TCP                   # first "ports" possibility
        port: 1111
      - protocol: TCP                   # second "ports" possibility
        port: 2222
```

The *NP* above has one rule with two conditions and two condition-entries each, it can be read as:

```
allow outgoing traffic if:
  (destination pod has label app=db1 OR destination pod has label app=db2)
  AND
  (destination port is 1111 OR destination port is 2222)
```

Using this *NP* it would still be possible for `backend-*` *Pods* to connect to `db2-*` *Pods* on port 1111 for example which should be forbidden.

 

###### Create NetworkPolicy

We create the correct *NP*:

```
k -f 24_np.yaml create
```

And test again:

```
➜ k -n project-snake exec backend-0 -- curl -s 10.44.0.25:1111
database one
➜ k -n project-snake exec backend-0 -- curl -s 10.44.0.23:2222
database two
➜ k -n project-snake exec backend-0 -- curl -s 10.44.0.22:3333
^C
```

Also helpful to use `kubectl describe` on the *NP* to see how k8s has interpreted the policy.

Great, looking more secure. Task done.

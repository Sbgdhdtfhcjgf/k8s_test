## Question 17 | Find Container of Pod and check info

*Task weight: 3%*

 

Use context: `kubectl config use-context k8s-c1-H`

 

In *Namespace* `project-tiger` create a *Pod* named `tigers-reunite` of image `httpd:2.4.41-alpine` with labels `pod=container` and `container=pod`. Find out on which node the *Pod* is scheduled. Ssh into that node and find the containerd container belonging to that *Pod*.

Using command `crictl`:

1. Write the ID of the container and the `info.runtimeType` into `/opt/course/17/pod-container.txt`
2. Write the logs of the container into `/opt/course/17/pod-container.log`

##### Answer:

First we create the *Pod*:

```
k -n project-tiger run tigers-reunite \
  --image=httpd:2.4.41-alpine \
  --labels "pod=container,container=pod"
```

Next we find out the node it's scheduled on:

```
k -n project-tiger get pod -o wide

# or fancy:
k -n project-tiger get pod tigers-reunite -o jsonpath="{.spec.nodeName}"
```

Then we ssh into that node and and check the container info:

```
➜ ssh cluster1-node2

➜ root@cluster1-node2:~# crictl ps | grep tigers-reunite
b01edbe6f89ed    54b0995a63052    5 seconds ago    Running        tigers-reunite ...

➜ root@cluster1-node2:~# crictl inspect b01edbe6f89ed | grep runtimeType
    "runtimeType": "io.containerd.runc.v2",
```

Then we fill the requested file (on the main terminal):

```
# /opt/course/17/pod-container.txt
b01edbe6f89ed io.containerd.runc.v2
```

Finally we write the container logs in the second file:

```
ssh cluster1-node2 'crictl logs b01edbe6f89ed' &> /opt/course/17/pod-container.log
```

The `&>` in above's command redirects both the standard output and standard error.

You could also simply run `crictl logs` on the node and copy the content manually, if it's not a lot. The file should look like:

```
# /opt/course/17/pod-container.log
